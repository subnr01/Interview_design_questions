Given two arrays which are sorted, find out the median of the two sorted arrays.  

Given an array as input find the output array that has median of each sub array whose index starts from 0 to i(i = 1,2...array.length-1).

Remove duplicates in an unsorted array where the duplicates are at a distance of k or less from each other. 

Flip a matrix.

give you a graph and two vertices and return if there exists a path between them

Determine whether a cycle exists

Given an unsorted list of integers, return true if the list contains any duplicates within k indices of each element. Do it faster than O(n^2). 

Give 3 distinct algorithms to find the K largest values in a list of N items.  

Implement external mergesort given text file of numbers.


Given a string of integers of undefined length, how would you choose an element uniformly at random using only a constant amount of space? How would you prove that your algorithm is correct?  

Do a binary tree traversal with constant memory (no stacks).
